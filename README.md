# MuPlaza by Joseph Phillips
Portfolio project I am currently working on.   

This project is a RESTful api that uses Spring Boot (gradle) and implements the [last.fm api](https://www.last.fm/api/).   
The database used is a MySQL database - the default name in application.properties to connect to the database is simply 'muplaza' (without the quotes).   
The frontend is handled with ThymeLeaf, Bootstrap and jQuery.
