## Bluebook - An interactive learning environment
A refurbished version of my dissertation project.
## About
During the course of my third year at university I worked on Bluebook as my disseration project. At the end, I was fairly happy with the result but I had learnt a lot over the course of my final year and I considered a lot of the code to be 'spaghetti' code and would be hard to maintain. This project is meant to a refurbishment where I follow better coding standards and use a much more up to date technologies.
This is still a work a progress.
## Building
First, make sure you have JDK 14 installed. Open a terminal in the root directory, cd to the Bluebook folder and run the following command:
# Windows
gradlew bootrun
# Linux
./gradlew bootrun
