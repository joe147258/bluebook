# Bluebook - An interactive learning environment
A refurbished version of my dissertation project. It is a Spring Boot based web platform using ThymeLeaf as a templating engine. This version of the project is still incomplete.

## Project Background and Motivation
When a student first joins university it feels very different to secondary school or college. Often the lecturers feel quite distant to many students and some may struggle to adjust, feel out of their depth and as a result underachieve in their academic work. The principle behind Bluebook is to help students get used to tracking their own progress as well as encourage lecturers to track & assist students that are lagging. As lecturers have an ever-increasing workload this web application is designed to save time for both students and lecturers.

## Aim
The primary aim of this project is to simplify and digitise tracking performance of students in college and university. The application is web based and therefore easily accessible for computers and mobile devices. Bluebook also encourages more direct communication between struggling students and lecturers. As well as being designed to be used as a resource to revise it also provides easy access to previously set work. 

## About
During my final year of university, I worked on Bluebook as my dissertation project. While I was fairly happy with the final result of the project, I had learnt a lot during my final year. This repository is a refurbishment of my final year project where I have approached it with a wider scope in mind and with superior coding practices. I decided to recreate my project from scratch as I wanted to tackle some of the early design decisions differently.  

## Building
First, make sure you have JDK 14 installed. In the application.properties (located at bluebook\src\main\resources) you must connect it to a MySQL database.
Once this is set up, open a terminal in the root directory, cd to the Bluebook folder and run the following command:
### Windows
gradlew bootrun
### Linux
./gradlew bootrun
